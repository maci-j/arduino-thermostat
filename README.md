# Arduino Dimmer Thermostat
An Arduino-controlled light dimmer thermostat intended for animal use.
## Introduction
This project is intended to help you create an affordable dimmer thermostat for usage on animal enclosures (though I imagine it would work fine for other uses as well). This iteration of the design is fairly simple; it controls only one heat source based on temperature parameters set in the code. However, it would be easy to modify this design to accommodate additional heat sources, temperature warning alarms, clocks, or humidity probes. 
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PROJECT DOES INVOLVE SOME ELECTRICAL WIRING. DO NOT DO THIS IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. I am not responsible for any damages if something goes wrong.
